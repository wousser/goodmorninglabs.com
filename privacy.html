  <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
  <p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong><br>
    This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally
    Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security,
    is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single
    person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear
    understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in
    accordance with our website.</p>

    contact details or other details to help you with your experience.</p>

  </p>

  <p><strong>Third-party disclosure</strong> <br>
    We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
  <p><strong>Third-party links</strong> <br>
    We do not include or offer third-party products or services on our website.</p>
  <p><strong>Google</strong> <br>
    Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to

    We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.</p>
  <p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong> <br>
    When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's
    Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer
    protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do
    to protect children's privacy and safety online.<br>
    We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>
  <p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong> <br>
    The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts
    they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
    Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with
    the various privacy laws that protect personal information.<br>
  </p>
  <p><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should
      a data breach occur:</strong> <br>
    We will notify the users via in-site notification within 7 business days<br>
    <br>
    We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue
    enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not
    only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts
    or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
  </p>
  <p><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong> <br>
    The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial
    messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties
    for violations.<strong></strong><br>
    <strong>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</strong> <br>
